# NYC Apartment Finder

This project aims to assist users in finding a new apartment in New York City that offers a quiet neighborhood with plenty of greenery.

## Project Overview

When your apartment lease is ending, finding a new place can be a daunting task. Utilizing datasets from NYC Open Data and Zillow’s historical monthly rent averages, this project revolves around creating a single Jupyter notebook to download, clean, and store data. We will define a set of SQL queries and visualizations to aid in the search for an ideal living area within your budget in New York City.

## Datasets

This project leverages the following datasets:

1. Shapefiles of NYC’s zip codes with geometric boundary data.
2. Historical monthly average rents by zip code from Zillow.
3. Historical data from NYC Open Data on 311 complaints and the 2015 tree census.

## Tools Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- SQL

## Project Steps

1. **Data Processing**: Downloading and cleaning the datasets to ensure quality and usability.
2. **Storing Data**: Storing the cleaned data in an appropriate format for further analysis.
3. **Understanding Data**: Writing SQL queries to extract datasets under specific conditions.
4. **Visualizing Data**: Creating visualizations for certain datasets to aid in understanding and decision-making.


This project integrates multiple datasets to provide a comprehensive tool for users to find housing options in NYC that meet their specific needs.
